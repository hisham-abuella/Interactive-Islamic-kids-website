                    <p>Long, long ago, in the beautiful land of Arabia, there lived a very special man named Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him). He loved Allah very much and always trusted in Him, no matter what happened.</p>

                    <p>One day, Allah asked Prophet Ibrahim to do something very difficult. He was asked to leave his beloved wife Hajar and their baby son Ismail in a hot, empty desert with no water or food around. Can you imagine how hard that must have been?</p>

                    <p>Prophet Ibrahim had complete trust in Allah. He knew that Allah would take care of his family. As he was leaving, his wife Hajar asked him, "Did Allah command you to leave us here?" When Ibrahim said yes, she replied with great faith, "Then Allah will not let us be lost."</p>

                    <p>Baby Ismail became very thirsty in the hot desert. His mother Hajar ran between two hills, Safa and Marwa, seven times looking for water. She never gave up hope! And then, a miracle happened! Water began to flow from under baby Ismail's feet. This blessed water is called Zamzam, and it still flows today!</p>
